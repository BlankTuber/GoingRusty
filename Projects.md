# Project Ideas and Tasks

## AI & ML

1. **Voice Assistant**: **Rust, C++**  
   * Build a voice assistant using Rust or C++ for high performance. You can use libraries like `rustling` for natural language understanding and `gstreamer` for audio processing.
2. **Image Recognition**: **Go, Rust, TensorFlow C++ API**  
   * Develop an image recognition system using Go or Rust for the backend, with TensorFlow's C++ API for integrating machine learning models. This avoids Python and JavaScript while still leveraging powerful image recognition libraries.

## Modding & Extensions

1. **Minecraft Mod**: **Java**  
   * Minecraft mods are traditionally developed in Java, so this will stay as is. You can use Forge or Fabric for modding, which are both popular Java frameworks for Minecraft mods.
2. **Browser Extension**: **Rust, WebAssembly (WASM)**  
   * Create a browser extension using Rust compiled to WebAssembly. This would allow you to develop high-performance browser extensions without using JavaScript. You could leverage frameworks like `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-pack`.

## P2P & Serverless Communication

1. **P2P File Sharing**: **Rust, WebRTC**  
   * Build a peer-to-peer file-sharing application using Rust for the backend and WebRTC for real-time communication. Rust's performance and WebRTC's peer-to-peer capabilities make this an ideal combination.
2. **Serverless Chat App**: **Go, WebRTC**  
   * Develop a decentralized chat app with Go for the backend and WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need for central servers.
3. **Custom VPN**: **Go, Rust**  
   * Implement a custom VPN using Go or Rust for both client and server components. WireGuard, a modern VPN protocol, can be used for tunneling.

## IoT & Data Visualization

1. **Weather Station**: **C, Rust, MQTT**  
   * Create a weather station using C or Rust on a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino). Use MQTT for sending data to a cloud service where it can be analyzed and visualized.
2. **Real-Time Data Visualization**: **Rust, D3.js (WASM)**  
   * For the real-time dashboard, you can use Rust for the backend and D3.js compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for front-end visualization, avoiding JavaScript while still using the powerful D3.js library.
3. **IoT Controller**: **Go, MQTT, React (or a Rust Frontend)**  
   * Build a platform or app that can control IoT devices using Go for the backend, MQTT for communication, and React for the frontend. Alternatively, use Rust with `Yew` for a fully Rust-based frontend.

## File & Data Management

1. **Encrypted File Storage**: **Rust, End-to-End Encryption**  
   * Create an encrypted file storage system with Rust for both the backend and file handling. Use libraries like `ring` for encryption and ensure secure data transmission and storage.
2. **Batch Image Processing**: **Rust, OpenCV (C++ bindings)**  
   * Use Rust for managing the processing and task orchestration, with OpenCV's C++ bindings for image manipulation. This avoids Python while maintaining performance.
3. **Custom File and Folder Management**: **Go, SQLite**  
   * Build a custom file management system using Go for backend logic and SQLite for local database support. This can handle metadata, file search, and tagging functionalities.

## System & Distributed Technology

1. **Distributed Database**: **Rust, Raft Consensus Algorithm**  
   * Develop a distributed database system with Rust for performance and safety. Implement the Raft consensus algorithm to handle replication and fault tolerance in a distributed environment.
2. **Custom Shell**: **Go, Rust**  
   * Build a custom shell using Go or Rust. Both languages are capable of creating high-performance command-line tools with features like piping, job control, and syntax highlighting.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: **Go, Docker, Jenkins (Self-hosted)**  
   * Build a CI/CD pipeline with Go for custom scripting, Docker for containerization, and Jenkins for automation. This setup avoids the need for Python while being highly customizable and self-hosted.

## Innovative & Creative

1. **Generative Music Composition**: **Rust, C++ (or a C++ AI library)**  
   * Use Rust or C++ to create an AI-based music composition tool. You could leverage libraries like `chordseq` or custom neural network implementations to generate music based on user input.
2. **AI-Summarizer Chrome Extension**: **Rust, WebAssembly (WASM)**  
   * Use Rust compiled to WebAssembly for creating the AI-summarizer Chrome extension, leveraging an external C++ AI library for natural language processing (NLP) and summarization.
