# GoingRusty by Blank

------------------------------------------------

## What its about

- *This is a collection of multiple small and big projects in which I try out new technologies and programming languages that I want to learn*

## Is this free to use?

- *Yes, use it however you want, but, make sure you're double checking that everything is safe and working, don't just assume it's perfect*

## About the projects under the Projects.md and the projects tab

- *Unless a folder for the given project has been made, it is probably just a placeholder project (like, an idea with a small description), which means it might change at any moment.*
